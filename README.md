# MyNodeJsAPP
Docker: You containerized the Node.js application, enabling it to run as a portable, isolated container that encapsulates the code and its dependencies.

Kubernetes: You managed the application deployment on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes helped automate the orchestration and scaling of containers, enhancing the applicationâ€™s availability and resilience.

Kubernetes Service: By using a LoadBalancer service, you exposed the application to enable external access. This LoadBalancer allocates a stable external IP address to route incoming traffic to the Node.js application, providing smooth user access.
